/**	\class State
 *   \brief Base class for implemented Application states.
 *
 *   States are used to specify how the Application behaves at a given point, in three places:
 *   <list type="bullet">
 *     <item>Input handling</item>
 *     <item>Logic</item>
 *     <item>Rendering</item>
 *   </list>
 *
 *  States can be stacked so that multiple states can run logic and be rendered at the same time,
 *  however only one state can process input at any time.  States are designed to be handled by a
 *  manager, and not manipulated directly.
